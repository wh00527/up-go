# 0.0.1-beta.2 (2016-02-29)

* Fixed minificaton of demo app
* Use Sass for demo styles

### Breaking Changes

* Removed `PaginationControlsDirective`, and simplified the way custom templates are specified (just put your template inside
the `<pagination-controls>` tags and use a local variable to access the API (see Readme).
* Removed `PAGINATION_DIRECTIVES` exported constant, since there is only 1 component to export now.
